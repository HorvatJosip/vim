The day started by me turning off the alarm. Then, I went to the bathroom to pee and apply Tiege Hanley. After that I joined work meeting. Once that was done, I grabbed something to eat.
I am grateful for many things, here are the three I have to write as part of the exercise:
* having a loving and caring family
* living in a good state
* having possibilities to interact with many people
